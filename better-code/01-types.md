The notion of a _type_ is a fundamental component of programming. Types are created to represent a class of objects. Types can be very general, such as “integer” or very specific such as “index into the collection of documents.”

### Definition of _incomplete type_

A _type_ is defined as:

> A type is a pattern for storing and modifying objects.

And an _object_ is defined as:

> An object is a representation of an entity as a value in memory. {::comment}Add reference to section 1.3 of Elements of Programming{:/comment}

The fact that an object exists _in memory_ is important. Objects are physical entities and are governed by the laws of physics, despite being oft referred to as _virtual_.

The basic building block for modern computers is the transistor. A transistor is a solid-state electronic switch. The first transistor-based computer was built in 1953{::comment}Citation{:/comment}. Prior to the use of transistors, computers were built with vacuum tubes, relays, or gears. {::comment}citation{:/comment} Any device that can serve as a controlled switch can be used to build a computer.

The symbol for a simple transistor is shown in {{figure-reference[figure-transistor]}}. Applying a voltage to the base allows current to flow from the collector to the emitter.
